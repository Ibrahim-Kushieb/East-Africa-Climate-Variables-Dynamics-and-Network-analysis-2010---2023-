# 🌍 Climate Variables Dynamics in East African Capital Cities

This project presents a choropleth map visualization of key climate variables across East African capital cities. It is developed using Python and hosted in a Google Colab notebook.

## 📊 Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize the spatial and temporal dynamics of climate variables in major East African capital cities. The climate variables considered include:

- 🌡️ Temperature  
- 🌧️ Rainfall  
- 💧 Humidity  
- 🌬️ Wind Speed  

Using a choropleth map approach, this project provides an intuitive way to compare and understand how these variables vary geographically and over time.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `climate_dynamics_east_africa.ipynb`: The main Google Colab notebook containing code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `data/`: Directory containing CSV or Excel files used in the analysis.
- `visualizations/`: (Optional) Saved images or outputs from the notebook.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Google Colab (Python 3)
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Plotly / GeoPandas (for choropleth mapping)
- Jupyter Notebook environment

## 🌐 Geographic Scope

This project focuses on the following East African capital cities:

- Nairobi (Kenya)
- Kampala (Uganda)
- Addis Ababa (Ethiopia)
- Khartoum (Sudan)
- Kigali (Rwanda)
- Dodoma (Tanzania)
- Juba (South Sudan)
- Djibouti (Djibouti)
- Mogadishu (Somalia)

## 📌 How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:

2. Run all cells after uploading the required data files (if needed).

## 📈 Outcomes

- Visual representation of climate trends over time.
- Easy comparison of weather patterns across East African capitals.
- Support for decision-making in climate adaptation and urban planning.
